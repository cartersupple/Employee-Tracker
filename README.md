## Usage 
A business needs to understand the inner working of the departments and the roles that reside in each department, the employees that fill those roles, and the managers they report to. This database allows a manager or executive to change roles of employees, add employee, add departments, add roles, and update an employees role. It will gather metrics surrounding the given schema.
